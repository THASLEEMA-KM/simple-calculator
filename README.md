<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->



REACT - ADVANCED Front End  TECHNOLOGY
---------------------------------------
- Features 
    - Components
    - Virtual DOM
    - JSX Language
    - High Performance
    - Data binding (sharing) : One way Data binding (from parent to child)
- Basic Concepts
    - Library, not a frame work.
    - React App is a collection of libraries.(Libraries - collection of files)
        to design page
        to send requests
        to make behaviour corresponding to that req
    - *Components : Part of User interface 
    - React App is a collection of Components
        - They are arranged in a tree structure
        - There will be a root Component in React app which is known as "App" (default name)
    - React Used to create Single Page Applications , which means page starts from a single page.always starts from the 'App'
    - Pure functions : which doesnt cause side effects, used to create react func compo
    - Declarative Approach 
    - *Virtual DOM : Light weight memory representation of real DOM
        - Reconciliation : the process to detect changes in page. only changed section refreshed.thus loadidng time reduced;website become faster
    - *JSX : Java Script XML -  (Language used to write code in React) - Used to display contents on browser
        - ex : JSX Elements : const heading = <h1>Heading 1</h1> ( we can assighn it into a variable , combination of html tags and js )
        - Rules for Using JSX 
            - Every JSX elements must be inside a single parent tag 
            - Parent Tag can be any container tag / react fragment (nameless tag <>...</>)
            - Every tag must has closing tag. ex : <h1>content</h1> , <br></br> instead of this use (<br/> = self closing tag) in react
            - Attribute class is "className" in React
            - Instead of Attribute 'for' use 'htmlFor' in JSX 
            - Use {js-expression} : To provide JS expression in JSX
        - React App Creation
            - CRA (using create-react-app command )
            - Vite : build tool for web projects
                - Installing vite Globally : npm i -g create-vite 
                - React app using vite : npm create vite@latest or [npm create vite@latest react-app -- --template react] 
        - React App File & Folder structure
                    - package.josn file : npm configuration file for the project
                    - package-lock.json file: holds versions history of all installed packages
                    - .gitignore file : containd files/folder name which is ignored while adding to git 
                    - index.html file: entry html page ot react app
                    - node-modules folder: used to hold copies of dependent libtraries of react project.(we can install using command : npm install)
                    - public folder : react project can access data stored in public folder as Globally
                    - src folder : define react app here
                        - assets folder : used to hold media files used in react app
                        - main.jsx file : created a ReactDOM with root as div with an id as 'root',
                                          and render the parent (App) Component inside the node 
                    - to run react app : use command 'npm run dev' 
                    - Babel Library : transpile JSX code to simple react function which is understood by browser.
                                      Used to convert the jsx into the langs which are understandable to the browser - html/js 
                - General Rules for Creating Components
                    - create a js / jsx file, filename must starts with caoptal letter
                - Different types of Components : 
                    - Class Based Components : use class to create component it can inherit react component class 
                        - Statefull Component, coz it can create state 
                    - Functional Components : stateless components, coz fun cant create object, use function to sreate Component 
                        using 'rfce' we can load the basic structure of functional based component structure
                    - Life cycle Methods of React Components
                        - Mounting Phase : Putting JSX into Browser
                            - constructor()
                            - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                            - render() if it is true jsx component is rended into DOM
                            - componentDidMount()
                        - Updating Phase : when component is Updating
                            - getDeriverdStateFromProps()
                            - shouldComponentUpdate() if it is true render() invoked
                            - render() 
                            - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                            - componentDidUpdate()
                        - Unmounting Phase : Removing componemt From DOM
                            - componentWillUnmount()

                - Difference between functional and class based compoenent                                                                     |
                        Functional Component                                             Class Compoenent                                      |

                            1. JS Pure function to accept props                 1. Is class extended from react compoenent                     |
                            and return JSX Element                              it render function return JSX Element                          |

                - Props Object : Property of a component, Using Props a component can get the shared data from its parent, 
                                 props will get as an argument of functional component
                - Styling JSX elements in React Component - Using CSS
                    - Using inline CSS   : Using style Attribute
                            - syntax : style={{Property:value}} (style as object, so represented as key-value pairs)
                    - Using External CSS : Using External css file,import css file to component file
                    - Using Module files : file with extention as .module.css is known as CSS Module file in component
                - React Events Binding 
                    - Binding a function without argument : event={function-name}
                    - Binding a function with argument : event={()=>function-name(arg)}
                    - Binding a function with argument as event : event={(event)=>function-name(e)}
                - Conditional Rendering : based on a condition we can control the JSX elements in browser
                    - if statements : use the operator truthy(&&) 
                    - if else statements : use ternary operator (?:)
                - React State : is an object used to store data /infronmation regarding a component , whenevever state change the component re-render 
                    - Use setState(value) : to update state
                - React Hooks : its a predefined function used to provide react component features to functional component
                    - Hooks are function name starts with 'use' keyword
                    - to use a hook in functional component we must call the hook
                    - Rules for calling hooks in functional component
                        - Import hook from react, in component
                        - hooks can be called at the top of level of component
                        - hooks cannot be conditional
                    - Types of hooks
                        - Predefined hooks
                            - useState(initial-value) : to help functional component to create state
                            - Syntax : const [state-name, state updating]
                            -useEffect(callback function, dependency) : used to provide side effects to your component
                                - function : used to define side effects applied to componenet
                                - dependency : based on dependency  useEffect will get invoked
                                    - no dependency : useeffect hook will call all timee in component
                                    - [] : useeffect will call only at the time in component creation
                                    - [data] : useeffect will call  at the time in component creation as well as data changes
                        - Customised hooks :
                            - create a function with the name starts with 'use' keyword
                        - Handling List using React
                            - using 'map' method
                            - to uniquely identify each item in a list use 'key' attribute in component
                        - Styling Framework in React
                            - Material UI : https://mui.com/material-ui/ 
                                - to installl : npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
                        - React Forms
                            - Controlled Components : data changes in  the form is handled by the component by storing its state using change event
                            - Uncontrolled : form handled by real DOM
                            - To submit form, preventDefault()
